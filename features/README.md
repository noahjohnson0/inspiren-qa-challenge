## Running Cucumber Tests

### Prerequisites
Make sure the development server is running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all Cucumber tests (default: Chromium)
npm run test:cucumber

# Run with visible browser (headed mode)
npm run test:cucumber:headed

# Run and generate HTML report for ALL browsers
npm run test:cucumber:report

# Browser-specific tests
npm run test:cucumber:firefox    # Firefox
npm run test:cucumber:webkit    # Safari/WebKit
npm run test:cucumber:edge      # Microsoft Edge
npm run test:cucumber:chrome    # Google Chrome

# Run tests on all browsers
npm run test:cucumber:all
```

### Available Test Scenarios

The `history-navigation.feature` file includes the following test scenarios:

1. **Turn History**
   - Display history of turns
   - Show correct number of history entries

2. **Back Navigation**
   - Allow going back to previous turns
   - Allow going back to game start

3. **State Restoration**
   - Properly restore game state when going back
   - Allow continuing from restored state

4. **History Management**
   - Maintain history after game reset
   - Handle history navigation edge cases

## Features

- **BDD Approach**: Tests are written in plain English using Gherkin syntax
- **Playwright Integration**: Uses existing Playwright infrastructure and page objects
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with type safety
- **HTML Reports**: Generates detailed HTML reports for test results
- **Flexible Execution**: Supports both headless and headed browser modes
- **ES Module Support**: Configured to work with modern ES module projects

## Integration with Existing Tests

The Cucumber tests reuse the existing:
- `GamePage` object model
- `TestUtils` helper functions
- Test data and utilities

This ensures consistency between Playwright and Cucumber test implementations while providing the benefits of BDD approach for stakeholder communication and documentation.

## Test Results

All 8 scenarios with 34 steps are currently passing:
